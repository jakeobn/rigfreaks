AMD Ryzen 5

The AMD Ryzen 5 is a fantastic choice for a gaming PC, offering a balance of performance and affordability. With its 6 cores and 12 threads, it handles demanding games and multitasking with ease. While it may not be the most powerful CPU on the market, it's more than capable of delivering smooth gameplay at high settings, especially when paired with a powerful graphics card like the GeForce RTX 4060.


GeForce RTX 4060

The GeForce RTX 4060 is a powerful graphics card that delivers exceptional performance for 1080p gaming. Leveraging the latest Ada Lovelace architecture, it supports ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, and DLSS 3 technology for higher frame rates and resolutions. Whether you're playing the latest AAA titles or competitive esports, the RTX 4060 is the right GPU for the job.


A520 motherboard

The A520 motherboard offers a solid foundation for a gaming PC. It features a robust power delivery system, ensuring stable power supply to the CPU during intense gaming sessions. The rear I/O panel provides a comprehensive array of ports, including USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports for high-speed data transfer, and a Gigabit Ethernet port for reliable network connectivity. The integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities offer wireless convenience.


High-speed DDR4 memory

This Chillblast gaming PC features 16GB of high-performance DDR4 memory, configured as two 8GB DIMMs. It delivers exceptional responsiveness, allowing for seamless multitasking, rapid application launches, ultra-smooth gaming experiences and stutter-free streaming.

80 PLUS Bronze certified

The 750W power supply is a reliable and efficient power source for a gaming PC. It delivers ample power for high-end components like the Ryzen 5 processor and GeForce RTX 4060. With 80 PLUS Bronze certification, it offers a balance of performance and energy efficiency.


Liquid cooled

To keep the powerful AMD Ryzen 5 processor cool we've chosen a powerful liquid cooler designed to ensure it's kept cool and quiet under heavy loads. The dual 120mm ARGB fans and efficient radiator ensure optimal thermal performance, while the customizable RGB lighting adds a stylish touch to your PC.
